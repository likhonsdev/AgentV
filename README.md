## 🌟 Performance Optimization

Sifra UI is optimized for performance in several ways:

- **Server Components** - Reduce client-side JavaScript for faster load times
- **Edge Runtime** - Minimize latency for API responses
- **Streaming Responses** - Display content progressively as it's generated
- **Optimized Assets** - Minimize and compress static resources
- **Code Splitting** - Load only necessary code for each page

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Secure API key handling using server-side environment variables
- Content filtering through Google's safety settings
- Client-side validation for user inputs
- Rate limiting for API requests
